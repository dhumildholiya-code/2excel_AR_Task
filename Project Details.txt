- I used unity ARCore template which they provide to kick start the project.
- I added AR Session origin which handles Camera to render.
- Then, I added AR Session which handles tracking and positioning.
- Then, I added 'AR Tracked Image Manager' component which ARCore library provide and handles image tracking.
- Then, I created Image Database which will be tracked and added QR code image to that database.
- Then, Created Quad using give Floor material which will be augmented when image will be tracked.
- then, I created scripts called FLoor, that can changed scaled of the floor object runtime.
- I created testing video to check the stabillity of the augmented object and tracked image.
- I got pretty good result.
